    <string name="tvHoofdtekst">Lightyear is more than an ordinary car manufacturer. We are a tech company on a mission: to bring about clean mobility for everyone, everywhere.</string>
    <string name="tvSubTekst">Cars currently contribute to 12% of European greenhouse gases emissions, and without radical change to the way we move it is a number set to increase drastically. While we need to revolutionise the way we travel, countries are struggling to build the necessary infrastructure to support the transition to electric vehicles.</string>
    <string name="tvSubtekst2">So what if we could leapfrog the grid and create a car charged by the sun? A car able to drive unprecedented distances without all the charging stops. This is Lightyear One, the worldâ€™s first long range solar car. Charge with the sun. Extend your range. Be sustainable.</string>
